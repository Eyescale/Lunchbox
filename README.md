# Introduction

Welcome to Lunchbox, a C++ library for multi-threaded programming. Lunchbox was
formerly known as eq::base or co::base, the foundation for the
[Equalizer parallel rendering framework](https://github.com/Eyescale/Equalizer)
and the [Collage network library](https://github.com/Eyescale/Collage). It is
intended for all application developers creating high-performance multi-threaded
programs.

The
[API documentation](http://eyescale.github.io/Lunchbox-1.12/index.html) can be
found on [eyescale.github.io](http://eyescale.github.io/). As with any open
source project, the available source code, in particular the
[unit tests](https://github.com/Eyescale/Lunchbox/tree/1.12/tests) provide a
reference for developing applications.

Technical questions can be posted to the Equalizer
[Developer Mailing List](http://www.equalizergraphics.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/eq-dev),
or directly to
[info@equalizergraphics.com](mailto:info@equalizergraphics.com?subject=Lunchbox%20question).

Commercial support, custom software development and porting services are
available from [Eyescale](http://www.eyescale.ch). Please contact

for further information.

# Building

Lunchbox is a cross-platform library, designed to run on any modern
operating system, including all Unix variants and the Windows operating
system. It requires a C++11 compiler and uses CMake to create a
platform-specific build environment. The following platforms and build
environments are tested:

* Linux: Ubuntu 16.04, RHEL 6.8 (Makefile, Ninja)
* Windows: 7 (Visual Studio 2012)
* Mac OS X: 10.9 (Makefile, Ninja)

Building from source is as simple as:

    git clone https://github.com/Eyescale/Lunchbox.git
    mkdir Lunchbox/build
    cd Lunchbox/build
    cmake -GNinja ..
    ninja
