    /* MPI library threading support is set by default to MPI_THREAD_SINGLE.
       Lunchbox is a multithreaded library, so, the required level of thread
       support should be MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED at least.

       NOTE:
       Be aware that MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE is only lightly tested and likely
       still has some bugs. Please, refer the below links:
       https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=supported-systems#thread-support
       https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/v1.4/man3/MPI_Init_thread.3.php

       MPI_Init_thread and MPI_Finalize:
       Should only be called once.
       Should only be called by a single thread
       Both should be called by the same thread, known as the main thread.

       Here, the MPI library is initialized and requested for
       MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE level of thread support. To make the library safe, if
       the thread support is not at least MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED, MPI
       communications will not be allowed.
